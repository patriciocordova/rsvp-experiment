The Alaska pipeline starts at the frozen edge of the Arctic Ocean. It stretches southward across the largest state in the United States, ending at a remote ice-free village nearly 800 miles from where it begins. It is massive in size and extremely complicated to operate.
The steel pipe weaves through crooked canyons, climbs sheer mountains, plunges over rocky crags, makes its way through thick forests, and passes over hundreds of rivers and streams. The pipe is 4 feet in diameter, and up to  84 million gallons of crude oil can be pumped through it daily.
The pipeline  rests on H-shaped steel racks called "bents."  The pattern of the pipeline's up-and-down route is determined by the often harsh demands of the arctic and subarctic climate, the tortuous lay of the land, and the varied compositions of soil, rock, or permanently frozen ground. More than half of the pipeline is elevated above the ground. The remainder is buried anywhere from 3 to 12 feet, depending largely upon the type of terrain and the properties of the soil.
One of the largest in the world, the pipeline cost approximately $8 billion and is  the biggest and most expensive construction project ever undertaken by private industry. In fact, no single business could raise that much money, so eight major oil companies formed a consortium in order to share the costs. Each company controlled oil rights to particular shares of land in the oil fields and paid into the pipeline-construction fund according to the size of its holdings. Today, despite enormous problems of climate, supply shortages, equipment breakdowns, labor disagreements, treacherous terrain, a certain amount of mismanagement, and even theft, the Alaska pipeline has been completed and is operating.
